# YAIM0425 d17b – Combustion without Pollution 🔥🌱

## 📦 Description

**YAIM0425 d17b – Combustion without Pollution** removes **pollution emissions from all entities that use combustible fuels**.

This MOD allows factories that rely on coal, solid fuel, rocket fuel, or other burnable resources to operate without generating pollution, making it possible to use combustion-based systems without environmental consequences.

It is ideal for players who want cleaner factories while still using traditional fuel-based power and production chains.

## ⚙️ How it works (Player view)

* All fuel-powered entities **stop emitting pollution**
* Fuel consumption and energy production remain unchanged
* No configuration or player interaction is required
* The effect is applied automatically when the MOD is enabled
